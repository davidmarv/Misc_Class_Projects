<!-- 
  Version of the sname game that I made in class for a simple project, I think the goal was to learn how to use the canvas element and javascript.
  It seems to not be fully functional ex. there is no losing, and I dont think the snake grows or anything like that.
  
  Changing src file between snake.js and snakeRewrite.js to see the difference between the two.
  The rewrite is just a little more expanded, it is by no means a full game
  and it keeps the terrible button controls, since I though it was funny
