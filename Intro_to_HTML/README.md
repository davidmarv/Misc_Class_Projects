This is a class project that I worked on for my Intro to HTML class. The project is made up of a few simple pages that work for a scrabble project. Since this was a group project, I am only including the files that I made.

This project was made in my sophomore year of college and does not reflect my current coding abilities. I am including it here for reference and to show my progress as a developer. I have since learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am now able to create more complex projects.
